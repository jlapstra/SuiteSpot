# SuiteSpot
Coding Test For SuiteSpot Technology

#To Run:

npx nx serve react-suite-portal
npx nx serve api

#Unit Tests:
One known unit test is failing due to an error with dependancies.
I believe this stems from having @type/react and react within the dependancy tree.
Removing dependancies brought on more errors. With more time I would figure this out.

#React-Bootstrap
React bootstrap was used for responsive and quick styling.
It is widley used and I have used it on other projects as well.

#Given More Time:
Given more time I would have completed the end to end testing, however I believed I had already gone over the suggested time.
The login requires you to login every time you go to the requests page. I would have liked to make it so that login was remembered for future.
I would also have liked to add some more color to the web app.

#Conclusion
Thank you so much for the opportunity to complete this coding challenge. I had a lot of fun completing it.
This is one of the first challenges that had starter code, although going through at the beginning to understand the code took some time, it provided a great new learning opportunity!
